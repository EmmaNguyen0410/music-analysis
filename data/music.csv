a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 47 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab i'ma kill you lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake 'em a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god67kembed,Eren,Male,24

29/08/2022,Find Me,Forest Blakk,Pop,04:51,08/06/2018,find me lyricsi was once told that walking through a doorway could cause someone to forget even the most precious memories they had memories of good memories of bad memories of love and of loss all tucked away neatly stored like the worn out blankets that were kept to dress the rainy days and bad habits that happen from time to time or what it felt like to rest your head on a friend's shoulder that still carries with it the creases from where you last placed your heart just like that gone within a single step that somehow three beams and an imaginary line drawn across some old aching floorboards were all that stood between you and the infinite silence of the very things that once colored your mind with sound it's funny you can make yourself believe almost anything if you if you think about it for long enough was that you i was once told that the love i felt beating inside my chest was nothing more than my mind playing an unfair trick on my heart and like a pair of dice dancing along the uneven pavement their fate much like yours or mine had already been decided that even the cracks that drew their faults between two opposing sides could not escape a fate that was always destined to be sealed to think that someone could actually believe that the swelling tides of my heart were no more than an anxious highway of ins and outs anchoring my imagination to the castles i've been building in the sky well maybe they are the crazy ones then again i have been known to misplace my hope in the way things fall and if i had to confess there stands a greater chance that i have all but lost my mind in here so i suppose its better off this way because ive always believed that the odds of finding what you seek tend to favor those who are open to seeking them in the first place and i for one have never quite understood how odds stand to get even without that frame in mind to be clear ive seen a million faces i've seen a million different faces each one mirroring that of your own and still none of them felt like home to me none of them have felt like you so here we are and i can vaguely and strangely trace your outline i can remember what it felt like to hold you i can remember what it was like to stare blindly into your eyes for what felt like an eternity how could i forget that i could never forget that i could never forget you no matter how long it takes for my words to make their way through the vastness of this place weve called home i unto you and you unto me i say them and will continue to do so day after day night after night never knowing if youll actually hear them there is no place for time here just overlapping moments where i thought id found you where i thought i heard the sound of your breath where i felt your heart as it waited patiently for mine retracing the steps that we left in the life before last before our eyes closed before the great divide before a doorway stood between you and me as it stands i've found myself in that doorway again with both feet in and your heart on my sleeve but i cant bring myself to walk through this time not yet at least not until i take one last look and see that it was you that it was always you our hearts strewn across those old fragile floorboards the silhouettes of each and every one of our memories playing out like a story that we both know weve seen before i remember now this was where i first found you and beyond those closed doors i will find you again my love i will find you again i will find you again i will find you i will find youembed,Arnald,Female,28
